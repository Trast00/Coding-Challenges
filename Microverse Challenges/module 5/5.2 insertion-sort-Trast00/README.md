## Challenge description

### Insertion Sort Itself

In Insertion Sort Part 1, you sorted one element in the array. Using the same approach repeatedly, can you sort an entire unsorted array?

#### Output
In this challenge print the array every time an element is “inserted” into the array in (what is currently) its correct place (even if it doesn't move). Begin printing from the second element and on.

#### Challenge
Can you print the steps of Insertion Sort?

#### Example
```
sort_itself([1, 4, 3, 6, 9, 2])
# => 1 4 3 6 9 2
#    1 3 4 6 9 2
#    1 3 4 6 9 2
#    1 3 4 6 9 2
#    1 2 3 4 6 9
```
